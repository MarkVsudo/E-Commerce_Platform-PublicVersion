# Clothing-Website
This is a clothing website I created for a brand. 

Due to commercial usage restrictions, the source code cannot be provided as the rights are owned by the company and are not intended for public use. 
Some of the images and the video are not owned by the brand, they are used for demonstration purposes.

## **Future Improvements:**

###### Database:

- Implement database **(MySQL preferably)**
- Admin and user profiles
- Admin profile should include a content management system **(add and manage products with GUI)**
- Have different statistics about users, purchases, etc. (Chart.js/D3.js/Highcharts/Plotly.js/Chartist.js/CanvasJS}) **(preferably chartist.js)**
- Authorization and Authentication
